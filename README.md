Overview

Modern surgeries are incredibly complex and challenging procedures, carrying risks for both patients and surgeons. In this situation, as many as 300,000 to 1.5 million patients may suffer intraoperative nerve injuries--many of which are permanent.

NerveSense hopes to tackle this challenge by detecting the proximity of surgical tools to peripheral nerves at the surgical site. To accomplish this task, eCAPs are elicited from the patient near the surgical site. To detect these electrochemical signals traveling down nerves, an electrode is used and slight differences in electric potential are used to calculate proximity. By using the conductive blade of a scalpel as an electrode, for instance, we can detect the relative proximity of nerves during surgery, preventing surgical errors and preserving nerve function.
